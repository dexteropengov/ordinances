The holding of office by any person who is in default shall create a vacancy unless such default shall be eliminated within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof has been served at the person's last known place of residence by the City Clerk, upon the direction of the Council; or unless the officer contests the liability for default in a court of competent jurisdiction. 
- (c) No person who holds or has held an elected office for the city shall be eligible to hold any appointive office for which there is compensation paid by the city until one year has elapsed following retirement or resignation, unless a waiver is granted by the Council by two-thirds (2/3) vote.

Unless the Council shall by two-thirds (2/3) vote record as part of its official proceedings, a determination that the best interests of the city shall be served, family members of any elective or administrative officer are disqualified from holding any appointive office or employment during the term for which said elective or appointive officer was elected or appointed. This section shall in no way disqualify such family members who are bona fide appointive officers or employees of the city at the time of the election or appointment of said official.

In order to exercise these powers, the Council shall have power to subpoena witnesses, administer oaths and require the production of evidence. A Council Member charged with conduct constituting grounds for forfeiture of office shall be entitled to a public hearing on demand, and notice of such hearing shall be published in one (1) or more newspapers of general circulation in the city at least one (1) week in advance of the hearing.
- (c) A vacancy in the office of Mayor or Council Member shall be filled in the following fashion: 
     - (1) City Council shall appoint a qualified, registered city elector within sixty (60) days from the date the vacancy was created. The appointment shall be for the balance of the term if within thirty (30) months of the expiration of the term. If the unexpired term exceeds thirty (30) months, the appointee shall hold office only until the first council meeting following the date of the next regular city election, at which election the office shall be filled for the remainder of the term. 
     - (2) If at any time the membership of the City Council is reduced to less than four (4), the remaining members may, by a majority vote of the members then on Council, fill such vacancies until the next regular November city election so that there are four (4) members of Council. Council shall then fill additional vacancies as provided in this section. 
     - (3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no vacancy in any elective office shall be filled in any manner if the term of the person whose office has become vacant expires within ninety (90) days after the vacancy occurs.

#### Sec. 5.06. – Conflict of interest.

The use of public office for private gain or the appearance of private gain is prohibited. The City Council shall implement this prohibition by ordinance. This ordinance shall include a statement of purpose and shall provide for reasonable public disclosure of finances by officials and staff who provide input into the decision of making significant monetary expenditures, contractor selection and regulatory matters, and insofar as permissible under state law shall provide for fines and imprisonment for violations.
